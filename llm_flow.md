# üß† LLM Architecture: From Text to Output

This guide explains how Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT process text, from raw input to generated output. We‚Äôll walk through each step ‚Äî tokenization, embedding, attention, and final prediction ‚Äî using simplified examples and clear terms.

## 1. üî§ Tokenization

**Goal**: Break down raw text into smaller chunks (tokens) that a model can understand.

These tokens might be:

* **Words** (`"ChatGPT"`)
* **Subwords** (`"power" + "ful"`)
* **Characters**

### Popular Tokenization Algorithms

| Algorithm         | Description                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BPE**           | Byte-Pair Encoding: merges frequent pairs of characters or subwords. |
| **WordPiece**     | Similar to BPE, used in BERT.                                        |
| **SentencePiece** | Does not require pre-tokenization; trains on raw text.               |

### Special Tokens

These are added to handle structure:

* `[CLS]`: Beginning of input (used for classification)
* `[SEP]`: Separator between parts (e.g., question and context)
* `[PAD]`: Padding for uniform sequence length

### Example

```text
Input: "ChatGPT is powerful."
Tokenized: ["Chat", "GPT", " is", " powerful", "."]
Token IDs: [2011, 4536, 318, 1745, 13]
```

## 2. üì¶ Embedding Layer

**Goal**: Convert each token ID into a dense vector (a list of numbers) that represents its meaning.

### How It Works

* Each token ID is mapped to a high-dimensional vector (e.g., 768 floats).
* These vectors are **learned during training**.

### Analogy

Think of a token as a word, and an embedding as a numerical fingerprint that captures its context.

```python
embedding = torch.nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
vector = embedding(token_id)  # Outputs a vector like [0.32, -0.12, ..., 0.99]
```

## 3. üîÄ Linear Layers: Weights & Biases

**Goal**: Transform input vectors using learned mathematical operations.

### Components

* **Weights (W)**: Matrix that scales/rotates the input.
* **Bias (b)**: Added to shift the output.
* **Linear Transformation**:

  $$
  \text{Output} = \text{Input} \times W + b
  $$

These are used throughout the model, especially in computing attention.

---

## 4. üéØ Attention Mechanism (Self-Attention)

**Goal**: Let the model decide which words to focus on in a sentence ‚Äî even words far apart.

### Steps

1. Compute three vectors for each token:

   * **Q** (Query): What this word wants to know.
   * **K** (Key): What other words offer.
   * **V** (Value): The actual information.

   $$
   Q = \text{Embedding} \times W_q,\quad K = \text{Embedding} \times W_k,\quad V = \text{Embedding} \times W_v
   $$

2. Calculate attention scores:

   $$
   \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d}}\right) \times V
   $$

### Output

Each token now holds a **context-aware representation** ‚Äî it ‚Äúknows‚Äù what else is in the sentence.

### Types of Attention

* **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: Basic form.
* **Multi-Head Attention**: Multiple attentions in parallel to learn different types of relationships.

## 5. üîÑ Transformer Block

Each transformer block contains:

1. **Multi-Head Attention**
2. **Add & Normalize** (residual + layer norm)
3. **Feedforward Layer (MLP)**
4. **Add & Normalize** (again)

These blocks are **stacked** ‚Äî e.g., GPT-3 uses 96 such blocks!

## 6. üßº Output Layer

**Goal**: Predict the next token by generating probabilities over the entire vocabulary.

### Steps

1. Final vector from transformer ‚Üí Linear Layer ‚Üí Vocabulary Size
2. Apply **softmax** ‚Üí Converts to probability distribution

### Example

```text
Input: "ChatGPT is pow"
Model Output (softmax):
"powerful": 0.95  
"powered": 0.02  
"power": 0.01  
‚Üí Selected token = "powerful"
```
